        <h2>2. Our Credit Services</h2>
        <p>We provide credit assistance by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Helping you assess your business asset finance needs</li>
          <li>Providing indicative quotes and comparisons</li>
          <li>Collecting and processing your application information</li>
          <li>Submitting applications to our panel of lenders on your behalf</li>
          <li>Assisting with the settlement process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We are a credit licensee, which means we hold our own Australian Credit Licence
          and are directly responsible for our credit activities.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. The Lenders We Work With</h2>
        <p>
          We have relationships with a panel of lenders who provide asset finance products.
          Our lending panel includes banks, non-bank lenders, and specialist asset financiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you submit an application, we will assess which lenders from our panel may
          be suitable for your needs based on your circumstances, credit profile, and the
          asset being financed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not provide advice on which lender or product is best for you. We present
          options based on likely approval and your stated preferences.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How We Are Paid</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Our Platform Fee</h3>
        <p>
          We charge a flat platform fee of <strong>$800 (inclusive of GST)</strong> for
          our services. This fee is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only payable if your finance application settles</li>
          <li>Disclosed separately from the lender's interest rate</li>
          <li>Added to your loan amount at settlement (not paid upfront)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Other Payments We May Receive</h3>
        <p>
          We do not receive commissions from lenders. Our only fee is the $800 platform fee
          disclosed above.
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may receive:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Referral fees from partner businesses</li>
          <li>Bonuses from dealers or equipment suppliers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If any such payments apply to your transaction, we will fully disclose them to you
          before you accept a finance offer.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Example</h3>
        <p>
          For a $100,000 equipment loan:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Platform fee: $800</li>
          <li>That's it - no hidden commissions or trail payments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our flat fee model means we're incentivised to get you the best deal, not to
          steer you toward lenders who pay us more.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Other Fees You May Pay</h2>
        <p>In addition to our platform fee, you may be charged fees by the lender including:</p>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Credit Checks and Your Credit File</h2>
        <p>
          When you submit an application, we will request a credit report from one or more
          credit reporting bodies (Equifax, illion, or Experian). This will be recorded on
          your credit file as a "credit enquiry".
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple credit enquiries in a short period may affect your credit score. We
          recommend only submitting an application when you are ready to proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using our online calculator does not affect your credit score. Credit checks
          are only performed when you submit a full application.
